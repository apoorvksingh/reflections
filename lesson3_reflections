hen would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository allows for sharing the code on a public forum, allowing other users to view it and add their suggestions 
    and ideas to the code that can be accepted or rejected by the owner.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manually will allow me to sync between the two repositories only when i want to, so i might decide to update after a few meaningful commits or after everyone. In addition to this it would also save on the bandwidth required of moving it constantly.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is used to create a copy of another repository on Github within Github. A clone is used to make a copy of the github repository on the local machine while a branch simply adds a new route in the repository for testing new features etc that can later be incorporated in the master branch.
we will use fork when we want to create/edit our own version of someone elseâ€™s repository on Github and will use clone if we want to make those changes on our own machine. In case we decide to have two separate routes for our code we will use branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
