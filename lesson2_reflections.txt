1>What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

1>Git will create the required metadata files that’ll store the information required for maintaining the repository and commits. If we do not initialise the repository, we would have no way to track the changes and would end up simply working with a normal folder



2>How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

2> The staging area essentially serves as an intermediary where we can keep the files we are working on before we finally make a commit. This is different from the working directory and and the repository as the files in the staging area are in a sort of transitional state.



3>How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

3> we can only add files to the staging area once we are sure that we have made the required changes. in addition we can view the difference between the file in the staging area and the most recent commit using the git diff —staging command.
